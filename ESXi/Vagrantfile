  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  # config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

    #  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Virtual Network
    #    You should specify a Virtual Network!  If it's not specified, the
    #    default is to use the first found.  You can specify up to 4 virtual
    #    networks using an array format.  Note that Vagrant only looks at the
    #    first interface for a valid IP address.  BTW: This does not configure
    #    IP addresses.  This specifies which 'ESXi virtual network' is used for
    #    each network interface in your VM.  For most OS's DHCP is the default,
    #    so, you will need a DHCP server for each virtual network.  To set a
    #    static IP for interface 2, 3 or 4. see above 'config.vm.network'.
